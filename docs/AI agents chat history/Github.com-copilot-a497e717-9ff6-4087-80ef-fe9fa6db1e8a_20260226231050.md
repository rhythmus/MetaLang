Copilot said: Based on the repositories and projects you've
Based on the repositories and projects you've identified, you're interested in what I would call Language Resource Infrastructure and Standardization — a subdiscipline that sits at the intersection of several overlapping domains:

Primary Domain: Language Resource Management & Data Engineering
More specifically, this encompasses:

Linguistic Data Standards & Interoperability

Cross-linguistic data formats (CLDF, FoLiA, FLAT)
Language tagging and identification standards (BCP-47, ISO-639 series, ISO-15924, UN M.49)
Universal Dependencies and other standardized linguistic annotation schemes
Lexicographic & Morphosyntactic Data Organization

Dictionaries and word lists (open-dict-data/ipa-dict, wooorm/dictionaries)
Trigrams and language identification (wooorm/trigrams, wooorm/franc)
Endangered language documentation (livingtongues)
Metadata & Classification Systems for Language

Language identification and categorization (iso-3166, iso-639-2/3, bcp-47)
Unicode character property standards (unicode-org/cldr)
Geopolitical classifications (un-m49)
Linguistic Data Harmonization & Interoperability

Tools for matching and normalizing language tags (bcp-47-normalize, bcp-47-match)
Format conversion and unified access to heterogeneous linguistic resources
Broader Academic Context
This subdiscipline is often discussed under terms like:

Linguistic Data Infrastructure (LDI)
Language Resource Engineering
Digital Linguistics
Computational Lexicography & Morphology
Language Documentation & Technology (especially with resources like Universal Dependencies and endangered language initiatives)
Why This Matters
These repositories represent the "backbone" infrastructure that enables computational linguistics, NLP, and multilingual language technology to function at scale. They solve the fundamental problem of: "How do we organize, standardize, identify, and share linguistic data across languages, tools, and research communities?"

The projects you've selected prioritize transparency, standardization, and interoperability — making linguistic data discoverable, reusable, and interoperable across different tools and research contexts.

Would you say this characterization aligns with your research interests?

You said: Great! That's indeed my domain. Could you
Great! That's indeed my domain. Could you propose some relevant academic Journals in that field? Can you find repositiries that work specifically in that field, and may have bibTeX or other bibliographic addresses ("How to quote / accredite this repository") associated to their code?
Copilot finished thinking

Copilot said: Excellent! Let me now search for more
Excellent! Let me now search for more specific repositories in this field that have bibtex or citation metadata:Excellent! Based on my research, here are key findings for your interest in Language Resource Infrastructure and Standardization:

Relevant Academic Journals
Language Resources and Evaluation (Springer) — Premier venue for linguistic resource management, annotation, and interoperability
Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative — Focuses on markup standards (TEI) and digital linguistic resource structuring
ACL Anthology papers — Major publications from Association for Computational Linguistics on language resources and standards
Repositories with BibTeX/Citation Metadata
Based on my search, here are critical findings:

1. CLDF (Cross-Linguistic Data Formats)
Repository: cldf/cldf
Status: ✅ Has proper citation support
Topics: cross-linguistic-data, csvw, dataset, language, metadata, metadata-vocabulary, tabular-data
Stars: 62 | Forks: 17
This is THE gold-standard for your field and directly implements citation standards
2. Universal Dependencies
Citation Format: Uses CITATION.cff (GitHub's official format)
BibTeX Entry available through GitHub's "Cite this repository" button
Reference: canonical ACL paper at https://aclanthology.org/E17-5001/
3. Notable Repositories Found:
acoli-repo/annohub — Linguistic Linked Open Data infrastructure with metadata aggregation
proycon/folia — Framework for Linguistic Annotation (standardized annotation formats)
proycon/flat — Flat Linguistic Annotation Tool
fmatter/cldf-ldd — CLDF implementation for language documentation
4. wooorm's Language Infrastructure Projects
Your list includes excellent language standardization work:

iso-3166, iso-639-3, iso-639-2, iso-15924 — Language/script identification standards
bcp-47, bcp-47-normalize — Language tag standardization
trigrams, franc — Language identification tools
un-m49 — Geopolitical region codes
These likely have package.json citation metadata or should have CITATION.cff files
Key Recommendation for Your Research
To maximize discoverability and citation of your repositories, consider:

Add CITATION.cff files to repositories without them
Reference academic papers in README (especially if published at ACL, LREC, or Language Resources and Evaluation journal)
Link to documentation standards (CLDF, TEI, FoLiA, etc.)
Include metadata vocabularies (schema.org, Dublin Core, DCAT)
Note: My search for repositories with existing citation support returned limited results (5-50 total), suggesting this is an underserved area — most linguistic data infrastructure projects don't yet have formal citation metadata. This could be an opportunity to pioneer better citation practices in your domain.

Would you like me to help you create CITATION.cff files for specific repositories, or explore the existing metadata practices in projects like CLDF or Universal Dependencies?

Copilot said: Perfect! Your repository **MetaLang** is ideally positioned
Perfect! Your repository MetaLang is ideally positioned at the intersection of all the interests you mentioned. Let me connect the dots:

MetaLang's Position in Your Research Domain
Repository: rhythmus/MetaLang

Language: TypeScript
Description: "Translate, localize, internationalize linguistic and lexicograph terms, tags, etc."
Created: 13 hours ago (brand new!)
How MetaLang Connects to Your Domain
Your repo perfectly bridges the discipline I identified earlier:

Language Resource Infrastructure and Standardization with a focus on:

Linguistic Metadata Management — handling linguistic and lexicographic terms systematically
Internationalization (i18n) Standards — aligning with BCP-47, ISO-639 language tags
Lexicographic Data Exchange — similar concerns to CLDF, FoLiA, TEI
Cross-linguistic Terminology — the core concern of your reference repos (wooorm, CLDF, etc.)
Recommendations to Position MetaLang Within This Domain
1. Add Repository Metadata (Critical for Discoverability)
YAML
# Add to repository topics:
- language-resources
- localization
- terminology
- linguistics
- metadata-standards
- i18n
- lexicography
- language-tags
- cross-linguistic-data
2. Create CITATION.cff (Essential for Academic Credibility)
This makes your work citable in academic papers:

YAML
cff-version: 1.2.0
title: MetaLang
message: >-
  If you use MetaLang in research, please cite it using these metadata.
type: software
authors:
  - family-names: "[Your Name]"
    given-names: "[First Name]"

  MetaLang provides a multilingual, ontology-based framework for linguistic 
  metalanguage standardization. It resolves fragmentation in linguistic 
  terminology across traditions (academic, pedagogical, computational) by 
  establishing stable concept hierarchies and enabling cross-tradition 
  mapping of linguistic tags and annotations. The framework implements 
  a plugin architecture supporting Universal Dependencies, EAGLES, 
  school grammars, and domain-specific standards (rhetoric, morphology, 
  syntax). MetaLang bridges language resource infrastructure standards 
  including CLDF (Cross-Linguistic Data Formats), FoLiA (Framework for 
  Linguistic Annotation), TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), and Unicode 
  standards (BCP-47, ISO-639, ISO-15924), making it essential 
  infrastructure for multilingual NLP, linguistic annotation, 
  computational lexicography, and cross-linguistic language documentation.
