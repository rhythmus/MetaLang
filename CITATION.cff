abstract: >-
  MetaLang provides a multilingual, ontology-based framework for linguistic 
  metalanguage standardization. It resolves fragmentation in linguistic 
  terminology across traditions (academic, pedagogical, computational) by 
  establishing stable concept hierarchies and enabling cross-tradition 
  mapping of linguistic tags and annotations. The framework implements 
  a plugin architecture supporting Universal Dependencies, EAGLES, 
  school grammars, and domain-specific standards (rhetoric, morphology, 
  syntax). MetaLang bridges language resource infrastructure standards 
  including CLDF, FoLiA, TEI, and Unicode standards (BCP-47, ISO-639, 
  ISO-15924), making it essential infrastructure for multilingual NLP, 
  linguistic annotation, computational lexicography, and cross-linguistic 
  language documentation.
