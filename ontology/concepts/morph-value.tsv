The annexed state is characterized by modification of the noun's initial syllable: in Northern Berber, [masculine](#masculine) nouns typically take a _w-_ or _y-_ prefix (e.g. [_argaz_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/argaz#Kabyle) (“man”) → [_wergaz_](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=wergaz&action=edit&redlink=1)), while [feminine](#feminine) nouns may lose their initial vowel.

Q192613		ML_MORPH-VALUE_PRESENT	present tense	The [tense](#tense) of a [verb](#verb) used primarily to refer to an event, transaction, or occurrence happening now or at the present time. The verb [_see_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/see#English) in _I see my friend in the window_ is in the present tense. In many languages, including English, the present tense may also be used to refer to past or future events in certain contexts: _My plane leaves tomorrow morning_ (where [_leave_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leave#English) is a present verb that refers to the future), or: _John Lennon dies of gunshot wounds_ (as in a headline, where [_dies_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dies#English) is a present verb that refers to the past; see [historical present](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/historical_present)). While such uses are somewhat exceptional in English, the present tense is used much more widely in many languages. For example, the German present tense also covers some or most of the uses of the English future (_I will do_) and present perfect (_I have done_).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/present_tense
Q179230		ML_MORPH-VALUE_VERBFORM-INFINITIVE	infinitive	A non-[finite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/finite) verb form considered [neutral](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/neutral) with respect to [inflection](#inflection); depending on language variously found used with [auxiliary verbs](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/auxiliary_verb), in [subordinate clauses](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/subordinate_clause), or acting as a [gerund](#gerund), and often as the [dictionary form](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dictionary_form). In English, the infinitive is formed with the word [_to_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/to#English), e.g. to [_read_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/read#English).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infinitive
Q192302	ML_POS_VERB	ML_MORPH-VALUE_VERBFORM-GERUND	gerund	Any of various non-finite [verb](#verb) forms in various languages. In English, a "[gerund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund#Gerunds_in_English)" refers to a verb in its [_-ing_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ing#English) form when used in a way that resembles the use of a [noun](#noun). Despite showing noun-like behavior in the context of the surrounding sentence, gerunds show verbal behavior in the context of their own internal clause: they can take direct objects or be modified by adverbs. In this way, gerunds are distinguished from deverbal nouns ending in _-ing,_ which occur in noun phrases that can take determiners or be modified by adjectives. For example, "manufacturing" is a gerund in the following sentence: "Efficiently manufacturing this device is difficult." It is a [verbal noun](#verbal_noun) (not a gerund) in this sentence: "The efficient manufacturing of this device is difficult." In other languages, gerund can refer to a form that often functions as an [adverb](#adverb) to form [adverbial](#adverbial) phrases or the continuous tense.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gerund
