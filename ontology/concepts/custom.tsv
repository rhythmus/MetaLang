Many languages have clitic [pronouns](#pronouns) ([weak pronouns](#weak_pronoun)), which may be contrasted with [emphatic](#emphatic) or [strong](#strong) pronouns; for example, English [_'ll_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%27ll#English) is a clitic version of [_will_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/will#English) and generally attaches to the preceding word (_he'll_, _a little dab'll do ya_).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clitic
		ML_CUSTOM_COGNATE	cognate	[Descended](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/descend) from the same source [lexeme](#lexeme) of an [ancestor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ancestor) language.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cognate

		ML_CUSTOM_COLLOQUIAL	colloquial	Denotes words belonging to a spoken or vernacular variety of a language. These words are only properly used in a casual or familiar context. / This label is only used with some languages; with others it is treated as a synonym of [_informal_](#informal). If used, _colloquial_ is stronger than _informal_ (a general rule of thumb is that informal words may be used in the running text of a newspaper article, while a colloquial term would likely not appear without quotation marks). / **Note:** It is a common misconception that _colloquial_ somehow denotes "local" or a word being "[regional](#regional)". This is incorrect; the word root for _colloquial_ is related to [_locution_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/locution#English), not [_location_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/location#English).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/colloquial

Distinguish [epicene](#epicene).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/common_gender
		ML_CUSTOM_COMPARABLE	comparable	Of an adjective or adverb: able to be compared, having [comparative](#comparative) and [superlative](#superlative) forms that end in _-er_ and _-est_ (adjectives only), or in conjunction with the words _more_ or _most_, or sometimes _further_ or _furthest_. Examples: _big_, _bigger_, and _biggest_; _talented_, _more talented_, and _most talented_; _upstairs_, _further upstairs_, and _furthest upstairs_. Some adjectives are truly [**incomparable**](#incomparable), such as _daily_, _additional_, and _else_. Many other adjectives, such as _unique_, _existential_, and _bearable_ are generally considered incomparable, but controversially so, where examples can be readily cited of something being "_more bearable_" or "_most perfect_".	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comparable
		ML_CUSTOM_COMPARATIVE	comparative	An [inflection](#inflection), or different form, of a [**comparable**](#comparable) adjective showing a relative quality, usually denoting "to a greater extent" but not "to the ultimate extent".

		ML_CUSTOM_CONSTRUCT-STATE	construct state	In some languages, a grammatical form that is used in construing a noun or adjective with another noun or adjective. In the [Semitic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Semitic) languages, the construct form is usually a noun modified by a following noun in a genitive construction. The construct state of such a noun _X_ can usually be translated to English as _X of_. In [Persian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Persian), the construct state is typically used for all nouns and adjectives in a [noun phrase](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noun_phrase) except the very last.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/construct_state
		ML_CUSTOM_CONTAMINATION	contamination	The influence of one term on the development of another term whereby they come to have similar meanings or a similar sound; [conflation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conflation).

		ML_CUSTOM_COORDINATE-TERM	coordinate term	A term that is a different type of the same [hypernym](#hypernym) (loosely "category"). _Car_ and _bicycle_ are coordinate terms to each other, both being [hyponyms](#hyponym) of a shared [hypernym](#hypernym) _vehicle_. Although the term can be applied broadly – e.g. _car_ and _asteroid_ are both _things_ –, such usage is not useful in Wiktionary.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coordinate_term
		ML_CUSTOM_COORDINATIVE-COMPOUND	coordinative compound	A [nominal](#nominal) [compound](#compound) in which the two parts are coordinated and the intended meaning of the compound as a whole is a combination of the two parts. Also known as a [_dvandva_](#dvandva) compound. Examples in English are not common but are found in many other languages, e.g. Greek [_μαχαιροπίρουνο_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%80%CE%AF%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%BF#Greek) (machairopírouno, “cutlery”, literally “knife-fork”) and Yiddish [_טאַטע־מאַמע_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%90%D6%B7%D7%98%D7%A2%D6%BE%D7%9E%D7%90%D6%B7%D7%9E%D7%A2#Yiddish) (tate-mame, “parents”, literally “papa-mama”). / Contrast [exocentric](#exocentric) and [endocentric](#endocentric) compounds.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coordinative, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/compound
		ML_CUSTOM_COPULA	copula	A verb that links and equates its [subject](#subject) with its object; also called a [linking verb](#linking_verb). The most common copula is the verb _to be_, but others exist, such as _to seem_, _to appear_ and _to sound_. The object of a copula often has special properties. For example, it can be an [adjective](#adjective) (_John is very tall, the water runs cold_) when most verbs require their objects to be [nouns](#noun) or [pronouns](#pronoun). In addition, in languages with [case](#case) distinctions, the object of a copula is most commonly in the [nominative](#nominative) case, while the object of other verbs is usually in a different case, such as the [accusative](#accusative) case. Many languages (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew, Russian) use a _null copula_ (i.e. no word at all) in the present tense when English would use the words _am_, _are_ or _is_.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/copula
		ML_CUSTOM_CORPUS	corpus	A [collection](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/collection#Noun) of [writings](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/writing#Noun), often a large one such as a [libraryful](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libraryful#Noun) of [documents](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/document#Noun) in a particular [language](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/language#Noun), and sometimes a [subset](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/subset#Noun), such as those from a specific [era](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/era#Noun), a specific [demographic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/demographic#Noun), a specific [genre](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genre#Noun) or [register](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/register#English:_language_register), or a particular [author](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/author#Noun); also, such a collection in the form of an electronic [database](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/database) used for [linguistic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/linguistic) analyses. [Dictionaries](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dictionary#Noun) are built using the builders' own command of a language plus reliance on many [quotations](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quotation) ([quotes](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quote#Noun)) from [corpora](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corpus#Noun), which in [lexicography](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lexicography) are often called [citations](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/citation#Noun). Wiktionary offers help with finding and citing citations at [Wiktionary:Quotations/Resources](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Quotations/Resources) and a deeper list at [Wiktionary:Corpora](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Corpora).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corpus
		ML_CUSTOM_CORRUPTION	corruption	A change in the form of a word, expression or text in a non-specific, sporadic or nonstandard way, often as a result of [misunderstanding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/misunderstanding), [mispronunciation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mispronunciation) or [mistranscription](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mistranscription). Some linguistic scientists avoid using this term for [language change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_change) because it connotes [prescriptive](#prescriptive) value judgments about language changes that "should have been prevented" or that "have [debased](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/debase) the language." In contrast, linguistic science's [epistemology](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epistemology) of language does not hold that a [pidgin](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pidgin#Noun), for example, is "inferior" to the languages from which it was formed. The term _corruption_ as applied to language change was long widely used, though, even in dictionaries, and is still widely encountered. In many cases, where an older dictionary might say that word X is a corruption of word Y, some newer dictionaries might say that word X is by alteration from word Y.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corruption#English:_usage_prescription

		ML_CUSTOM_COUNTABLE	countable	Describes a noun which can be freely used with the [indefinite article](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indefinite_article) (_a_ or _an_ in English) and with numbers, and which therefore has a [plural](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plural) form. [Antonym](#antonym) of [_uncountable_](#uncountable) or _mass noun_.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/countable, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/count_noun
		ML_CUSTOM_COUNTER	counter	In linguistics, counters, [measure words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/measure_word) or [classifiers](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/classifier) are words that are used in combination with a numeral to indicate an amount of something represented by some noun. They denote a unit or measurement and are used with [mass nouns](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mass_noun), and sometimes also with [count nouns](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/count_noun). (Compare [_singulative_](#singulative).)	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/counter
		ML_CUSTOM_DATED	dated	Formerly in common use, and still in occasional use, but now unfashionable; for example, [_wireless_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wireless#English) in the sense of "broadcast radio tuner", [_groovy_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/groovy#English), and [_gay_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gay#English) in the sense of "bright" or "happy" are all dated. _Dated_ is not as strong as [_archaic_](#archaic) or [_obsolete_](#obsolete).

		ML_CUSTOM_DECLENSION	declension	The [inflection](#inflection) of [nouns](#noun) and words like them, or used together with them (i.e. [nominals](#nominal)). See also [_conjugation_](#conjugation).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/declension
		ML_CUSTOM_DEFECTIVE	defective	Normally would be expected to have a full set of [inflected](#inflection) forms, but some of the inflections do not exist or are never used. Examples include the English defective verbs [_can_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/can#English) and [_shall_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shall#English), which do not have [infinitive](#infinitive) forms (there is no *_to can_ or *_to shall_), or the French verb [_falloir_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/falloir#French), whose finite forms occur only in the third person singular ([_il faut_](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=il_faut&action=edit&redlink=1); there is no *_je faus_ or *_ils fallent_).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/defective
		ML_CUSTOM_DEFECTIVE-SPELLING	defective spelling	In languages with [matres lectionis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mater_lectionis) ([consonant](#consonant) letters representing [vowels](#vowel)), the form including no additional ones. The opposite is called [plene spelling](#plene_spelling) when its the standardized spelling and [excessive spelling](#excessive_spelling) when it has even more of those letters than the standard spelling requires.	
		ML_CUSTOM_DEFINITE	definite	Refers to forms of words that present something as known, identified, or immediately identifiable; in English, this is the basic meaning of the [article](#article) [_the_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the#English); in some languages, this is a nominal or adjectival [inflection](#inflection). In the Germanic languages, adjectives inflected as definite are referred to as "weak". In Hungarian, the definite conjugation is used to indicate [definite objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_verbs#Definite_and_indefinite_conjugations), including _him__, her_, _it__, them_, and the formal _you_.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/definite
		ML_CUSTOM_DEGREES-OF-COMPARISON	degrees of comparison	[Inflections](#inflection) of adjectives and adverbs which allow comparisons. English has three _degrees of comparison_: [positive](#positive), [comparative](#comparative) and [superlative](#superlative). Some other languages have other degrees, e.g.: [comparative superlative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comparative_superlative), [relative superlative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/relative_superlative), [elative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elative).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/degrees_of_comparison
		ML_CUSTOM_DEMONYM	demonym	A [noun](#noun) or [adjective](#adjective) referring to an inhabitant or native of a specific place. Sometimes the demonym is clearly related to the place name, as in English [_Mexico_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Mexico#English) and corresponding demonym [_Mexican_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Mexican#English), but sometimes it is not, as in the [_Netherlands_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Netherlands#English) vs. [_Dutch_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Dutch#English). Some languages (e.g. most Slavic languages) have different (but typically related) adjective and noun forms of a given demonym, while in other languages (e.g. most Romance languages), they are the same. English is inconsistent in this regard; contrast [_Mexican_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Mexican#English) (either an adjective or noun) with [_Swedish_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Swedish#English) (adjective) vs. [_Swede_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Swede#English) (noun). In some cases in English, such as [_Chinese_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chinese#English), there is no single-word singular noun form of a demonym that is fully accepted as [standard](#standard) in modern usage, leading to locutions such as _Chinese person_ or _person from China_.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/demonym
		ML_CUSTOM_DENOMINAL	denominal	Derived from a [noun](#noun).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/denominal
		ML_CUSTOM_DENOTATION	denotation	The [objective](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/objective) and [analytical](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/analytical) meaning (definition) of a word, as contrasted with its emotional overtones, which constitute its [connotation](#connotation). For example, the words _start_ and _commence_ usually have the same denotation (i.e., "begin"), but they often have ([subjective](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/subjective)) connotational difference (such that a parent might say, "start doing your homework as soon as you finish your snack and bathroom break" but would usually not say "commence doing your homework […]" because it sounds odd in a certain way (out of place in the context, unless emphasizing the word for humor, vocabulary building, or some other special purpose).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/denotation

		ML_CUSTOM_INFLECTION	inflection	The change in form of a word to represent various grammatical categories, such as [tense](#tense) (e.g. past tense, present tense, future tense) or [number](#number) (e.g. singular, plural). For example, the verb [_run_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/run#English) may be inflected to produce [_runs_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/runs#English), [_ran_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ran#English), and [_running_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/running#English).

		ML_CUSTOM_INTERNATIONALISM	internationalism	A loanword that occurs in several languages with the same or similar meaning and etymology, often due to the occurrence of several simultaneous borrowings and/or a chain of successive borrowings happening in quick succession. This commonly results in the exact etymological lineage of a term being difficult or impossible to trace for a given language.

For example, under certain circumstances in [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language), underlying _s; z; t; d; k; g_ are iotated to _š; ž; č or šč; ž; č; ž_ respectively (pronounced /ʂ/; /ʐ/; /t͡ɕ/ or /ɕː/; /ʐ/; /t͡ɕ/; /ʐ/ respectively). (See [_Appendix:Russian verbs § Slavic iotation_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Russian_verbs#Slavic_iotation) for the full iotation rules in [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language); other [Slavic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages) behave similarly.)	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/iotation
		ML_CUSTOM_IPA	IPA	The [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet); a standardized system for transcribing the sounds in any spoken language.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/IPA
		ML_CUSTOM_IRB	ʾiʿrāb	Also called [desinential inflection](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/desinential_inflection); in Arabic: [_إِعْرَاب_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A5%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8#Arabic) (ʔiʕrāb). A number of [inflectional](#inflection) endings, applied to Arabic nouns, adjectives, and verbs, which—with minor exceptions—do not appear in writing, and moreover are not pronounced in [pausa](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pausa), i.e. at the end of a sentence or before a pause. Nevertheless, these endings are a regular and required element of Qur'ānic and Classical Arabic. In Modern Standard Arabic, however, they are rather often avoided due to dialectal influence. In nouns and adjectives, the ʾiʿrāb primarily has the function of marking the cases ([nominative](#nominative), [genitive](#genitive), [accusative](#accusative)), while in verbs it marks the moods ([indicative](#indicative), [subjunctive](#subjunctive), [jussive](#jussive)). All of these are only occasionally distinguishable without application of the ʾiʿrāb.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CA%BEi%CA%BFr%C4%81b
		ML_CUSTOM_IRREGULAR	irregular	Not following the usual rules of [inflection](#inflection); for example, the plural of English [_man_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/man#English) is [_men_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/men#English), which is irregular; the regularly formed plural would have been *_mans_.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/irregular
		ML_CUSTOM_ITERATIVE	iterative	Expressive of an action that is repeated with frequency.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/iterative
		ML_CUSTOM_IZAFET	izafet	The [possessive](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/possessive) or [genitive](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genitive) construction in [Turkic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages) such as [Azerbaijani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani). The term, and sometimes the grammatical structure, is borrowed from Persian [_اِضافِه_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%87#Persian) (ezâfe) (see [ezafe](#ezafe)), which comes in turn from Arabic [_إِضَافَة_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A5%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A9#Arabic) (ʔiḍāfa) (see [ʾiḍāfa](#ʾiḍāfa)). Native _izafet_ constructions in Turkic languages are right-headed (the first term modifies the second), but some constructions (especially in elevated or older style, such as [Classical Azerbaijani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Azerbaijani) and [Ottoman Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Turkish)) are left-headed in imitation of Persian grammar. There are three native _izafet_ constructions: (a) type I, where both nouns are zero-marked; (b) type II, where the first noun is zero-marked and the second receives a possessive suffix; and (c) type III, where the first noun is in the genitive case and the second receives a possessive suffix.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/izafet
		ML_CUSTOM_JUSSIVE-MOOD	jussive mood	In certain languages (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic and Esperanto), a [mood](#mood) of a [verb](#verb) used to indicate a command, permission or agreement with a request (distinct from the [imperative](#imperative_mood)).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jussive
		ML_CUSTOM_KARMADHARAYA	karmadharaya	Another term for a [_descriptive compound_](#descriptive_compound). / Contrast [bahuvrihi](#bahuvrihi), [tatpurusa](#tatpurusa) and [dvandva](#dvandva).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/karmadharaya
		ML_CUSTOM_KATHAREVOUSA	Katharevousa	The [classically](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/classical_language) based artificial ([standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_language)) Greek language created at the start of Greece's independence from the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire). It was used for all formal and official purposes until 1976.(Note: In Wiktionary, Katharevousa terms are entered under (modern) [Greek](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Greek_language).)	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Katharevousa
		ML_CUSTOM_KENNING	kenning	A [metaphorical](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metaphorical) compound or phrase describing basic objects in an [allusive](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/allusive) fashion, especially in Germanic poetry.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kenning#English:_poetry
		ML_CUSTOM_KULTURWORT	Kulturwort	A type of [Wanderwort](#wanderwort) which is specific to a particular culture or which is spread by an influential cross-cultural phenomenon. Kulturworts (or _Kulturwörter_) are often names of products distributed by trade and religious or ideological terms.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Kulturwort
		ML_CUSTOM_LEARNED-BORROWING	learned borrowing	A [loanword](#loanword) that was borrowed directly on purpose, instead of through normal [language contact](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/language_contact), from another language, especially [classical languages](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/classical_language) such as Latin, Ancient Greek or Sanskrit, and which has not undergone significant reshaping due to [sound change](#sound_change) or analogy with inherited terms. Such borrowings are thus often [unadapted](#unadapted_borrowing). Compare with [semi-learned borrowings](#semi-learned_borrowing), which have been significantly reshaped ([adapted](#adapted_borrowing)), and [inherited](#inherited) terms, which have undergone all the normal sound changes of a language. A theme of Latin's influence on modern European languages is that in many cases the same Latin word has been borrowed into any given modern language multiple times in different eras, and the morphologic and semantic facts about each descendant word differ in predictable ways (by eras); a concise summary for the case of English (for example) is offered in some introductory textbooks, such as Burriss and Casson. A typical example of this process is that the Portuguese term [_artículo_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/art%C3%ADculo#Portuguese) (“[articulus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/articulus)”) is a learned borrowing from Latin [_articulus_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/articulus#Latin) (“joint, limb, division”); the term [_artigo_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artigo#Portuguese) (“article”) is a semi-learned borrowing from the same term, which was borrowed early enough to undergo later sound changes that [lenited](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lenite) _c_ into _g_ and deleted _l_ between vowels; and the term [_artelho_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artelho#Portuguese) (“toe”) is inherited from the same Latin term.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/learned_borrowing
		ML_CUSTOM_LEMMA	lemma	The headword or citation form of an [inflected](#inflection) word, i.e. the form under which a word is found in a dictionary. For example, in English, nouns are usually listed under their singular form (_apple_, rather than _apples_), and verbs under their infinitive form (_open_, rather than _opens_, _opened_ or _opening_). Which form is used as the lemma varies from language to language. For verbs, for example, French, German, Spanish and many other European languages use the [infinitive](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infinitive), but Latin, Greek and Bulgarian use the [first-person](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/first-person) [singular](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/singular) [present](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/present) [indicative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indicative), while Macedonian uses the [third-person](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/third-person) [singular](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/singular) [present](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/present) [indicative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indicative), and Arabic and Hebrew use the [masculine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/masculine) [third-person](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/third-person) [singular](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/singular) [past](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/past) [indicative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indicative). See also [Wiktionary:Lemmas](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Lemmas).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lemma
		ML_MORPH-VALUE_LETTER-CASE	letter case	The distinction between [majuscule](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/majuscule) ([uppercase](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uppercase)) and [minuscule](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/minuscule) ([lowercase](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lowercase)) letters.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/letter_case
		ML_CUSTOM_LEXEME	lexeme	The abstract "word" underlying a set of inflections; for example, _gives_ and _given_ belong to the same lexeme, which is usually identified by its lemma form [_give_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give#English). See also: (1) [Wikipedia's article on lexemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lexeme), (2) [Wiktionary:Languages with more than one grammatical gender](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Languages_with_more_than_one_grammatical_gender), (3) [conjugation](#C) and (4) [declension](#D).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lexeme
		ML_CUSTOM_LIAISON	liaison	The phonological fusion of two consecutive words and the manner in which this occurs, for example intrusion, consonant–vowel linking, etc.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/liaison
		ML_CUSTOM_LIGATURE	ligature	A character that visually combines multiple letters, such as [_æ_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A6#Translingual), [_œ_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C5%93#Translingual), [_ß_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%9F#Translingual) or [_ĳ_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C4%B3#Translingual).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ligature
		ML_POS_LINKING-VERB	linking verb	Another term for [copula](#copula).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/linking_verb

		ML_CUSTOM_LOANBLEND	loanblend	A [partial calque](#partial_calque).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loanblend
		ML_MORPH-VALUE_LOCATIVE-CASE	locative case	[Locative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/locative). A [case](#case) used to indicate place, or the place where, or wherein. It corresponds roughly to the English prepositions "in", "on", "at", and "by". Some languages use the same locative case construct to indicate when, so the English phrase "in summer" would use the locative case construct.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/locative_case
		ML_MORPH-VALUE_LOCATIVE-QUALITATIVE-CASE	locative-qualitative case	Nouns in the form of the locative-qualitative case are qualifiers in the sentence and signify the locational or temporal mark of the qualified word. The qualifier is not specific but general or universalized. / See also [_Appendix:Uyghur nouns_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Uyghur_nouns).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/locative-qualitative_case
		ML_CUSTOM_LOGOPHORICITY	logophoricity	Logophorical pronouns (logophors) are personal pronouns in some languages (such as Ainu, Ewe and Japanese) that marks the speaker when being quoted (or the entity whose thoughts or feelings are being reported).

		ML_CUSTOM_MACRON	macron	A short, straight, horizontal [diacritical](#diacritic) mark ( ¯ ) placed over any of various letters, usually to indicate that the pronunciation of a [vowel](#vowel) is long.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/macron
		ML_CUSTOM_MARKED	marked	The quality of a sound (etc.) to [stand out](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stand_out) in some way compared to a more [trivial](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trivial) or [default](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/default) counterpart (which is **unmarked**), such as by requiring an extra [feature](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/feature) to [articulate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/articulate) or by carrying a [morphological](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/morphological) power absent from the unmarked form.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/marked
		ML_POS_MASS-NOUN	mass noun	_See [_uncountable_](#uncountable)._	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mass_noun
		ML_CUSTOM_MEASURE-WORD	measure word	_See [_counter_](#counter)._	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/measure_word
		ML_CUSTOM_MEDIOPASSIVE	mediopassive	The grammatical [voice](#voice) that subsumes the meanings of both the [middle voice](#middle_voice) and [passive voice](#passive_voice). Several languages (e.g. [Sanskrit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sanskrit), [Greek](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Greek), [Icelandic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Icelandic) and [Albanian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Albanian)) make a [morphological](#morphology) distinction between active and mediopassive voices, and in such languages, the mediopassive can have either middle, passive or (often) [reflexive](#reflexive) semantics. Often used interchangeably with the [middle voice](#middle_voice).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mediopassive
		ML_CUSTOM_MEN-S-SPEECH	men 's speech	In certain languages (for example, [Karajá language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaj%C3%A1_language)), men and women use or historically used distinct words and inflected forms. / Compare [women's speech](#women's_speech).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/men, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/speech
		ML_CUSTOM_MERGER	merger	In etymology, a [confluence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/confluence) of two etymologically separate sources into eventually one and the same term, motivated by a coincidental [phono-semantic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/phono-semantic) similarity between them. For example, Old English [_nǣmel_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/n%C3%A6mel#Old_English) (“receptive, quick to grasp”) and [_numol_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/numol#Old_English) (“able to take, capable of holding”) apparently merged into English [_nimble_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nimble#English), which absorbed the [semantics](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/semantics) of both words. An extreme type of [conflation](#conflation). Contrast [_blend_](#blend). In phonology, a [sound change](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sound_change) that results in two [phonemes](#phoneme) (typically referring to [vowels](#vowel)) becoming one phoneme as a result of increasingly similar pronunciation over time. This need not affect an entire language, but will (at least initially) apply to a particular [variety](#variety) of the language, such as one regional “[accent](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accent)” or [dialect](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dialect). Example: the recent [cot-caught merger](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cot-caught_merger) affecting some English speakers.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/merger
		ML_CUSTOM_MERONYM	meronym	A term that denotes a part of the whole that is denoted by another term. For example, the word "arm" is a **meronym** of the word "body". The term which describes the _whole_, as being an opposite of meronym, is [_holonym_](#holonym).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meronym
		ML_CUSTOM_METAPHORICAL	metaphorical	The use of a word or phrase as a [metaphor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metaphor) to refer to something that it is not, invoking a direct similarity between the word or phrase used and the thing described. See also [simile](#simile) and [figurative](#figurative).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metaphorical
		ML_CUSTOM_METANALYSIS	metanalysis	_See [_rebracketing_](#rebracketing)._	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metanalysis
		ML_CUSTOM_METATHESIS	metathesis	A [sound change](#sound_change) in which two sounds or groups of sounds exchange position in a word. A form showing metathesis is described as [_metathetic_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metathetic#English). The sounds may be adjacent, as in [_ax_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ax#English), the metathetic form of the verb [_ask_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ask#English), or farther apart, as in Spanish [_palabra_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palabra#Spanish) from Latin [_parabola_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/parabola#Latin); there, the sound change is [hyperthesis](#hyperthesis).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metathesis
		ML_CUSTOM_METONYM	metonym	A figure of speech which substitutes one part for the whole. For example, to count how many cattle in a herd, one counts the heads. To describe the herd, one would say, "There are fifty head of cattle." This does not mean there are only heads, but the head is substituting for the whole animal.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metonym
		ML_CUSTOM_MIDDLE-VOICE	middle voice	The [voice](#voice) verb form in which the [subject](#subject) of a verb performs some action upon itself, as in the English sentence _The plane landed_ (contrast [active voice](#active_voice) _The pilot landed the plane_ and [passive voice](#passive_voice) _The plane was landed (by the pilot)_). Often used interchangeably with the [mediopassive voice](#mediopassive_voice). In some languages, such as [Sanskrit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sanskrit), [Ancient Greek](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek), [Icelandic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Icelandic) and [Albanian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Albanian), the middle voice is distinguished [morphologically](#morphology) from the active voice. [Ancient Greek](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek), in particular, has a three-way morphological distinction between active, middle and passive voices in the [aorist](#aorist) and [future](#future) tenses.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/middle_voice
		ML_CUSTOM_MINCED-OATH	minced oath	A euphemism based on a profanity that has been altered to reduce or remove the objectionable characteristics of the original expression. Examples in English include [_heck_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heck#English) instead of [_hell_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hell#English) and [_dang_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dang#English) instead of [_damn_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/damn#English).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/minced_oath
		ML_CUSTOM_MIXED	mixed	A type of declension in German that uses endings that are a combination of [strong](#strong_declension) and [weak](#weak_declension) endings. In adjectives, the mixed declension is used when accompanied by an indefinite article, or more generally by an [_ein_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ein#German)-word (a determiner that has a null ending in the nominative masculine and neuter singular, similar to the indefinite article [_ein_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ein#German)). The mixed declension uses strong endings precisely in those inflections where the indefinite article has a null ending, and weak endings otherwise. By analogy, nouns declined according to the mixed declension look like strong nouns in the singular (with genitive in _-s_ and/or _-es_) but weak nouns in the plural (with plural in _-n_ and/or _-en_). Most mixed nouns were once weak nouns that have transitioned to strong nouns in the singular but maintain the original weak plural ending. See [Category:German mixed nouns](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:German_mixed_nouns) for a list of German mixed nouns.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mixed
		ML_CUSTOM_MONOLECTIC	monolectic	Used of a grammatical form accomplished with one word (compare [polylectic](#polylectic) and [periphrastic](#periphrastic)).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monolectic

		ML_CUSTOM_MOOD	mood	One of the forms of a [verb](#verb), used to indicate the speaker's attitude toward what they are saying (e.g. a statement of fact, of desire, of command, etc.). Examples include [indicative](#indicative_mood), [subjunctive](#subjunctive_mood), [imperative](#imperative_mood), [conditional](#conditional_mood).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grammatical_mood
		ML_CUSTOM_MORPHOLOGICAL	morphological	In [linguistics](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/linguistics), the study of words and how they are formed from component parts ([morphemes](#morpheme)). It also refers to the structure of the words themselves. Some languages lean more heavily on morphology to carry grammatical distinctions, while others rely more on [syntax](#syntax). Compare English _I make_, _I will make_, _it is made_ (using syntax to encode [person](#person), [tense](#tense) and [voice](#voice) distinctions) vs. Latin [_faciō_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/facio#Latin), [_facem_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/facem#Latin), [_facitur_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/facitur#Latin) (using morphology).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/morphological
		ML_POS_MULTIDIRECTIONAL-VERB	multidirectional verb	In the [Slavic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages), a verb of motion whose motion is multidirectional (as opposed to unidirectional) or indirect, or whose action is repeated or in a series ([iterative](#iterative)). Also called an [abstract verb](#abstract_verb) or [indeterminate verb](#indeterminate_verb). The opposite type of verb, which expresses a single, completed action, is termed a [unidirectional verb](#unidirectional_verb) (also [concrete verb](#concrete_verb) or [determinate verb](#determinate_verb)). Motion verbs in the [Slavic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages) come in multidirectional/unidirectional lexical pairs, e.g. Russian [_ходи́ть_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C#Russian) (xodítʹ, “to [go](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/go)”, multidirectional) vs. [_идти́_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%82%D0%B8#Russian) (idtí, “to [go](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/go)”, unidirectional), [_бе́гать_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C#Russian) (bégatʹ, “to run”, multidirectional) vs. [_бежа́ть_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C#Russian) (bežátʹ, “to run”, unidirectional), [_носи́ть_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C#Russian) (nosítʹ, “to carry”, multidirectional) vs. [_нести́_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8#Russian) (nestí, “to carry”, unidirectional). English does not make this distinction. For example, "I went to the post office" could be multidirectional (if I went there and came back) or unidirectional (if I am there now), and different Russian verbs would be used to translate "went" in these two circumstances. In Polish coming back does not cause multidirectional verbs to be used, only doing something many times (_Chodzę do biura._ 'I go to the office (every day).' vs. _Idę do biura_ 'I am going to the office (now).') or moving without target (_Chodzę po pokoju_ 'I am walking around the room.' vs. _Idę przez pokój._ 'I am walking across the room.') does. In many Slavic languages, multidirectional verbs are always [imperfective](#imperfective_aspect) in [aspect](#aspect), even with prefixes that are normally associated with the [perfective aspect](#perfective_aspect) (e.g. Polish _przybiegać_). Czech–Slovak languages work differently, as they differentiate between perfective pairs as well, e.g. Czech imperfective _nést_ and _nosit_, perfective _nanést_ and _nanosit_ (the imperfective form is _nanášet_).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/multidirectional, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/verb
		ML_CUSTOM_MUTATION	mutation	The property of a sound in a word, often a [consonant](#consonant) but possibly a [vowel](#vowel) (as in [ablaut](#ablaut) and [umlaut](#umlaut)), altering due to its [morphological](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/morphology) or [syntactic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/syntax), as opposed to [phonological](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/phonology), context. Examples of consonant mutations include the word-initial consonant mutations found in many Celtic languages.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mutation
		ML_CUSTOM_MUTEH	muteh	In French, an initial ⟨h⟩ that is treated like a [vowel](#vowel); that is to say, [liaison](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/liaison) and [elision](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elision) are permitted at the beginning of words that have a mute h.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mute_h

Palatalization still operates [synchronically](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/synchronically) before a /j/, producing, for instance, the pronunciations [_gotcha_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gotcha#English) and [_didja_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/didja#English) from _[_got_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/got#English) [_you_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/you#English)_ and _[_did_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/did#English) [_you_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/you#English)_.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palatalization

Plosives are distinguished from [fricatives](#fricative), in which the air is mostly but not completely blocked, enough to cause a rough, hissing or buzzing sound, and [approximants](#approximant), in which the airflow is only slightly constricted, resulting in a smooth sound.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plosive
		ML_CUSTOM_PLUPERFECT	pluperfect	A verb form of [perfect](#perfect) [aspect](#aspect) and [past](#past) [tense](#tense), which is used to describe an action or event which is regarded as having been completed in the past, in relation to a time already in the past.

Commonly [idiomatic](#idiomatic), such as in [pinheaded](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pinheaded) or [red-faced](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/red-faced). Not to be confused with [possessive adjectives](#possessive_adjective), which indicate who possesses a noun, or [relational adjectives](#relational_adjective), which are often formed in the same way. See also [privative adjectives](#privative_adjective), which denote the opposite.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/possessional_adjective

For example, in Russian, [_Петро́в_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2#Russian) (Petróv) is an adjective meaning “Peter's”, derived from [_Пётр_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%91%D1%82%D1%80#Russian) (Pjotr, “Peter”); and in Czech [_mámin_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m%C3%A1min#Czech) is an adjective meaning “mom's/mum's”, derived from [_máma_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m%C3%A1ma#Czech) (“mom, mum”).

		ML_CUSTOM_POSSESSIVE-DETERMINER	possessive determiner	A [determiner](#determiner) that indicates ownership. For example, in "her book", the word "her" indicates whose book it is. Not to be confused with [possessional adjectives](#possessional_adjective), which indicate what a noun possesses, and [possessive adjectives](#possessive_adjective) in [Slavic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages), which are adjectives that are semantically equivalent to the genitive case of proper names or personal nouns.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/possessive_determiner

Some adjectives are only-predicative like [_afraid_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/afraid#English) or [_glad_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/glad#English) in English. In Russian, it often specifically refers to an adjective-like [part of speech](#part_of_speech) that serves as the entire predicate of a sentence in an [impersonal](#impersonal) construction. Such constructions often cannot be translated word-for-word in English. An example is [_ску́чно_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE#Russian) (skúčno, “it is [boring](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/boring)”) in the sentence _[_мне_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%8F#Russian) [_ску́чно_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE#Russian)_ (mne skúčno, “I am [bored](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bored)”, literally “It is boring to [me](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/me)”).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/predicative

		ML_CUSTOM_PRESCRIPTIVE	prescriptive	Concerning [linguistic prescription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_prescription): how some users of a language think it [ought to](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ought_to) be used, as contrasted with how it is [in fact](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_fact) used, which is sometimes different; compare [_descriptive_](#descriptive). Prescription is not the same thing as [standardness](#standard). Example: Both of the following options are [standard](#standard), although one has a history of being [proscribed](#proscribed) (by some speakers, because of [contextual](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contextual#Adjective) disapproval of degree of [formality](#formal)): "Between you and I, we've got it all covered." "Between you and me, we've got it all covered."	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prescriptive
		ML_CUSTOM_PRETERITE	preterite	A [tense](#tense) showing an action at a determined moment in the past. In general it is thus the union of the [past tense](#past_tense) with the [perfective](#perfective) aspect, although in some languages it is little more than a synonym for past tense.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preterite, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preterit
		ML_POS_PRETERITE-PRESENT-VERB	preterite-present verb	In [Germanic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Germanic) languages, a verb that displays (or historically displayed) [ablaut](#ablaut) in the present tense, and thereby had _present_ tense forms resembling the _past_ (or _preterite_) tense of a [strong verb](#strong_verb). Most languages have no more than a handful of such verbs, and they are often used as [auxiliary verbs](#auxiliary_verb). English examples are [_shall_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shall#English), [_can_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/can#English), [_may_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/may#English). / Contrast [strong verb](#strong_verb), [weak verb](#weak_verb).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preterite-present_verb
		ML_CUSTOM_PREVOCALIC	prevocalic	Occurring before a following vowel.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prevocalic
		ML_POS_PRIVATIVE-ADJECTIVE	privative adjective	An adjective indicating that a noun refers to an object that is not of the class which that noun ordinarily refers to. For example, in the term "fake weapon", the word "fake" denotes that the object is not a weapon, just as the word "toy" in "toy car" denotes that it is not a car. An adjective indicating that a noun lacks some other noun (or a quality of that noun), usually formed in English by adding the suffix [_-less_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-less#English) or [_-free_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-free#English) to the noun that is absent. For example, someone is [beardless](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beardless) if they don't have a beard, while a coffee might be [sugar-free](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sugar-free) if it contains no sugar. Commonly [idiomatic](#idiomatic), such as in [brainless](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brainless) or [heartless](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heartless). See also [possessional adjectives](#possessional_adjective), which denote the opposite.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/privative_adjective
		ML_CUSTOM_PRODUCTIVE	productive	Used to form new words and phrases. For example, when a new verb appears in Modern English, the productive suffix [_-ed_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ed#English) is used to form its past participle; by contrast, the suffix [_-en_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-en#English:_plural_noun) appears in many existing past participles, but is not productive, in that it is not (usually) used to form new ones.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/productive
		ML_CUSTOM_PROGRESSIVE	progressive	The [aspect](#aspect) of a verb, indicating that the action described is, was or will be continuing, uncompleted or repeated. A verb form indicating that an action is [in progress](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_progress). In English, formed from a combination of _be_ + the present participle (_-ing_ form) of the verb. So one can have present progressive (e.g. _is painting_), past progressive (e.g. _was painting_), future progressive (e.g. _will be painting_), etc. Similar to, but less general than, the [imperfective](#imperfective) [aspect](#aspect). (See also [_continuous_](#continuous).)	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/progressive
		ML_POS_PRONOMINAL-VERB	pronominal verb	A form of [verb](#verb) that has an attached [pronoun](#pronoun); this is a prominent feature of [Romance](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Romance_language) and Slavic languages.

		ML_CUSTOM_PROSCRIBED	proscribed	Some authorities or commentators recommend against or warn against the listed usage. Wiktionary's use of this label does not mean that Wiktionary itself advocates the proscribing, nor that all speakers of the language agree with the proscribing. Wiktionary does not issue editorial opinions but rather simply reports facts about usage, including usage advice that exists and that some people follow because, for example, a citable [reference work](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reference_work#English) is known (by many speakers) to recommend it. Proscribing (forbidding) is understandable both (1) as the negative _type_ of [prescribing](#prescriptive) when the latter means "dictating [dos and don'ts](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dos_and_don%27ts)" and (2) as the [opposite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/opposite#Noun) of [prescribing](#prescriptive) when the latter means "preferring".	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/proscribe
		ML_CUSTOM_PROTHESIS	prothesis	The prepending of [phonemes](#phoneme) at the beginning of a word without changing its morphological structure, as in [_nother_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nother#English), from [_other_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/other#English) (“a whole nother thing”, via [tmesis](#tmesis)), or Spanish [_esfera_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/esfera#Spanish) from Latin [_sphaera_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sphaera#Latin) (“sphere”).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prothesis
		ML_CUSTOM_PROTOLOGISM	protologism	A [neologism](#neologism) or any coined word with very limited use. By definition, protologisms do not meet Wiktionary's [criteria for inclusion](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion). / See also [Appendix:Protologisms](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Protologisms).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/protologism#Noun

		ML_CUSTOM_PSEUDO-LOAN	pseudo-loan	A word in one language that appears to be a direct borrowing from another language, but does not exist in that language or has an unrelated meaning. Examples from English include French [_footing_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footing#French) (“jogging”), German [_Bodybag_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bodybag#German) (“messenger bag, courier bag”), Japanese [_サラリーマン_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%B5%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3#Japanese) (sararīman, “white-collar worker, '[salaryman](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/salaryman)'”) and Swedish [_afterwork_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/afterwork#Swedish) (“informal gathering after work”).

		ML_CUSTOM_REBRACKETING	rebracketing	The process by which a word originally derived from one source is broken down or bracketed into a different set of factors. The understanding of [_hamburger_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hamburger#English) as [_ham_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ham#English) + [_burger_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/burger#English) (rather than [_Hamburg_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hamburg#English) + [_-er_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-er#English)) is an example of rebracketing.

For example, Modern English [_heat_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heat#English) is the reflex of the Old English [_hǣtu_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/h%C3%A6tu#Old_English). / Rarely, this word is used in reverse, and the 'reflex' is actually the root word rather than the descendant word. However, this usage is usually filled by the term [_etymon_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/etymon#English) instead.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reflex
		ML_CUSTOM_REFLEXIVE	reflexive	Referring back to the subject, or having an object equal to the subject. Pronouns can be reflexive (e.g. [_myself_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/myself#English), [_oneself_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oneself#English)).

Consider an English phrase such as _chicken soup_. In English, this phrase can be constructed by simply placing a noun such as _chicken_ in the position normally occupied by an adjective, i.e. directly before the noun. In languages such as Russian, however, this cannot be done, and instead the word [_ку́рица_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0#Russian) (kúrica, “chicken”) must be replaced by the relational adjective [_кури́ный_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9#Russian) (kurínyj, “related to chickens”) when forming the Russian equivalent _[_кури́ный_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9#Russian) [_суп_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%81%D1%83%D0%BF#Russian)_ (kurínyj sup, “chicken soup”). Generally, adjectives of this sort cannot be qualified by _more_, _less_ or _very_. This concept relates to the concept of the [noun adjunct](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noun_adjunct) or, in English [attributive noun](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attributive_noun).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/relational

		ML_CUSTOM_STANDARD	standard	Conforming to the [standard variety](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/standard_variety#Noun) or [standard language](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/standard_language#Noun). Contrast [_nonstandard_](#nonstandard). Standardness in linguistics is [descriptive](#descriptive), but part of the phenomenon that description describes is the fact that some [prescriptive](#prescriptive) notions can influence standardness via a [feedback loop](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/feedback_loop). Usages can be [informal](#informal) but standard, even when they are not [formal](#formal) and even when they are [proscribed](#proscribed) by some speakers. A [standard variety](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/standard_variety#Noun) is often a [prestige variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prestige_(sociolinguistics)). This can cause some confusion about [nonstandardness](#nonstandard) equalling [_inherent_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inherent#Adjective) "inferiority", "incorrectness", or "wrongness" when all it really equals is [_contextual_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/context#Noun) inappropriateness. Within a single language, a [wordform](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wordform#Noun) or [usage](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/usage#English:_language) can be an [idiomatic](#idiomatic) norm within some [varieties](#variety) even when it is not the norm in the [standard variety](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/standard_variety#Noun). (For example, in English this is true of the [zero copula](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/zero_copula) in a sentence such as _He gone already_.) It can also be the idiomatic norm in [informal](#informal) register within the standard variety even when it is often avoided [formally](#formal) therein. (In English this is true, for example, of most [contraction](#contraction) use.) These facts explain the important difference between [code-switching](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/code-switching#Noun) and speaking "incorrectly" ([as if](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/as_if) with _inherently_ "wrong" forms or usage).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/standard#English:_linguistics
		ML_CUSTOM_STATIVE	stative	Of a verb: expressing a [state](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/state) rather than an [action](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/action) or [activity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/activity). Many Bantu languages have a verbal extension/suffix to derive stative verbs from other verbs, often with [inchoative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inchoative) or [potential](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/potential) meaning.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stative
		ML_CUSTOM_STEM	stem	The part of an [inflected](#inflection) word that the ending is attached to. For example, Latin _mens-_ (“table”, stem) +‎ [_-ae_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ae#Latin) (ending, 1st-declension nominative plural) → [_mensae_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mensae#Latin) (“tables”, full word, nominative plural).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stem
		ML_CUSTOM_STRATUM	stratum	A language that influences another by [contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_contact), typically due to close geographic proximity (often both spoken simultaneously in the same land) and some form of cultural contact. A stratum can be further classified as [substrate](#substrate), [superstrate](#superstrate), or adstrate.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stratum
		ML_CUSTOM_STRICTLY	strictly	Indicates a more precise use of words; short for _strictly speaking_ ([sensu stricto](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sensu_stricto)). / Contrast _loose_ or _broad_ (_wide_) sense; [_loosely_](#loosely).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strictly
		ML_CUSTOM_STRONG-DECLENSION	strong declension	In German, a declension of adjectives, and of masculine and neuter nouns, that is defined in opposition to the [weak declension](#weak_declension) and [mixed declension](#mixed_declension). Strong nouns (typically) form their genitive in _-s_ and/or _-es_ and do not form their plural by adding _-n_ and/or _-en_. In adjectives, the strong declension is a set of endings used when the adjective is not accompanied by a definite or indefinite article, and includes a fuller set of endings than that of the weak or mixed declensions (hence the name). Note that "strong", "weak" and "mixed" refer to inherent declensional properties of nouns, but all adjectives can be declined according to all three declensions, depending on whether an article precedes and what type of article it is. By analogy, the term "strong declension" is sometimes used in other inflected Germanic languages such as [Icelandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic) and [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English). In these languages, adjectives are formed similarly to German but there is typically not a single strong noun declension. Rather, a strong noun is any noun that does not follow the weak declension.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strong_declension#English
		ML_POS_STRONG-PRONOUN	strong pronoun	In Greek, an [emphatic pronoun](#emphatic).	
		ML_POS_STRONG-VERB-AND-STRONG-CONJUGATION	strong verb and strong conjugation	In [Germanic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Germanic) languages, a verb that displays [ablaut](#ablaut). More specifically, a verb that has a change in [vowel](#vowel) between present and past. An English example is [_drink_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drink#English), [_drank_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drank#English), [_drunk_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drunk#English). Note that some verbs show a vowel change, but not as a result of ablaut (e.g. [_think_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/think#English), [_thought_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thought#English)); these are not considered strong verbs. / Contrast [weak verb](#weak_verb), [preterite-present verb](#preterite-present_verb).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strong_verb
		ML_CUSTOM_SUBJUNCTIVE-MOOD	subjunctive mood	The [mood](#mood) of a [verb](#verb) expressing an action or state which is [hypothetical](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hypothetical#Adjective) or [anticipated](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anticipate#Verb) rather than actual, including [wishes](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wish) and [counterfactuals](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/counterfactual#Noun). Some English examples are _if I were rich_ and _it’s important that he be here_. In many languages [imperative](#imperative) (command) [inflections](#inflection) are the same as or similar to subjunctive ones, reflecting the shared trait of non-[indicative](#indicative) nature: yet-[unrealized](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unrealized) ideas.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/subjunctive_mood
		ML_CUSTOM_SUBORDINATE-CLAUSE	subordinate clause	Same as [dependent clause](#dependent_clause).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/subordinate_clause

For example, the main sense of [_butter_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/butter#English) is the uncountable sense, so the plural form _butters_ is seldom used, although it occasionally is used to mean "types of butter" (many [_herb butters_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/herb_butter) contain garlic) or "[packets of] butter". Compare also other implicit references to a container and the portion/serving that it contains (_get me a water, order two sodas, have a few beers_).
