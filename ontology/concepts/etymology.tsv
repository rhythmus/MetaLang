	ML_ETYMOLOGY_PROCESS	ML_ETYMOLOGY_ABLAUT	ablaut	In [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European), or any of its descendants (the [Indo-European](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Indo-European) languages), a system of [vowel](#vowel) alternation in which the vowels that are used in various parts of the word can change depending on meaning. The system is used for purposes of [inflection](#inflection) and word derivation. In the Germanic languages, it forms the basis of the [strong verbs](#strong_verb).

	ML_ETYMOLOGY_PROCESS	ML_ETYMOLOGY_ANALOGY	analogy	An etymological process in which a word or form is created after a certain pattern in an attempt to right a perceived irregularity. For example, in English, [_dove_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dove#English) as the past tense of [_dive_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dive#English) (instead of [_dived_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dived#English)) is by analogy with strong verbs like [_drive_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drive#English) → [_drove_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drove#English) and [_weave_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/weave#English) → [_wove_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wove#English).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/analogy
	ML_ETYMOLOGY_PROCESS	ML_ETYMOLOGY_ANGLICISATION	anglicisation	The modification of a foreign ([borrowed](#loanword)) word to make it more English in form.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anglicisation, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anglicization
	ML_ETYMOLOGY_PROCESS	ML_ETYMOLOGY_BORROWING-ADAPTED	adapted borrowing	A [loanword](#loanword) formed with the addition of an [affix](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/affix) to conform the term to the normal [morphology](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/morphology) of the [language](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/language), e.g. Polish [_normatywny_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/normatywny#Polish), borrowed from French [_normatif_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/normatif#French) and adapted with Polish [_-ny_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ny#Polish). / Contrast [unadapted borrowings](#unadapted_borrowing).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/adapt, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/borrowing

Q103808		ML_ETYMOLOGY_LOANWORD	loanword	A word that was [adopted](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/adopt#Verb) ([borrowed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/borrow#Verb)) from another language, rather than formed within the language or inherited from a more ancient form of the same language. Such a word may be [adapted](#adapted_borrowing) or [unadapted](#unadapted_borrowing). Loanwords may still be recognisably foreign (having non-native spelling or unusual pronunciation) ([unadapted](#unadapted_borrowing)), or they may have become completely assimilated into the language (no longer perceived as foreign). For example, in English, [_schadenfreude_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schadenfreude#English) is still recognisably German, whereas [_cellar_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cellar#English) is fully assimilated and no longer recognisably Latin (from [_cellārium_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cellarium#Latin)). Sometimes a [naturalized](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/naturalize#English:_linguistics) loanword can be both fully assimilated _and_ still recognised as having foreign origin (e.g. [_taco_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taco#English), [_burrito_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/burrito#English)). Compare [loan translation](#calque) ([calque](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/calque)).	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loanword, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loan, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/borrowing
