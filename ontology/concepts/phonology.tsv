	ML_PHONOLOGY_SEGMENT	ML_PHONOLOGY_SEGMENT-AFFRICATE	affricate	A [consonant](#consonant) sound made up of a [plosive](#plosive) and a [fricative](#fricative) pronounced simultaneously, together behaving within a language's [phonology](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/phonology) as if one single consonant. English has the affricates /t͡ʃ/, as in _church_, and /d͡ʒ/, as in _judge_. Some languages are known to distinguish affricates from an otherwise-identical sequence of a plosive followed by a fricative, such as Polish [_czy_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/czy#Polish) /t͡ʂɘ/ vs. [_trzy_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trzy#Polish) /tʂɘ/.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/affricate
