Q1306636	ML_POS_DET	ML_POS_DETERMINER	determiner	A noun modifier that expresses the in-context reference or quantity of a noun or noun phrase. Determiners are often considered adjectives, but in fact are not quite the same; for example, in English, [_big_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/big#English) is an adjective, so “the big car” is grammatical while *“He saw big car” is not, but [_some_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/some#English) is a determiner, so *“the some car” is not grammatical while “He saw some car” is. In English, adjectives can _sometimes_ stand alone without a noun, while determiners nearly _always_ can (contrast *“He saw big” with “He saw some”), such that they are sometimes considered pronouns as well as adjectives.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/determiner

Q4833830		ML_POS_PREPOSITION	preposition	A word, normally non-[inflecting](#inflection), that is typically employed to connect a following [noun](#noun) or [pronoun](#pronoun), in an [adjectival](#adjective) or [adverbial](#adverb) sense, with some other word. Examples of prepositions in English are _in_, _from_ and _during_. Note that some languages have [postpositions](#postposition) instead of prepositions; they function like prepositions but come _after_ the noun or pronoun being connected.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preposition
Q36224		ML_POS_PRONOUN	pronoun	A [part of speech](#part_of_speech) that acts as a substitute for a [noun](#noun) or [noun phrase](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noun_phrase) and refers to a topic of the discussion. Pronouns can refer to a participant in the discussion and can be used instead of a person's name, such as with the pronouns [_I_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/I#English) and [_you_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/you#English). Other pronouns, such as [_he_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/he#English), [_she_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/she#English), and [_it_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it#English), can be used to refer to other people or objects that have already been mentioned without repeating their names.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pronoun
Q147276	ML_POS_NOUN	ML_POS_PROPER-NOUN	proper noun	A kind of [noun](#noun) that usually refers to a specific, unique thing, such as [_Earth_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Earth#English) and [_the Alps_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Alps#English), though one language's proper noun may translate to another language using a _common_ (not proper) noun. In English, proper nouns are usually capitalized, as are common nouns and adjectives derived from proper nouns. The same word may have both common-noun and proper-noun senses (such as [_German_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/German#English), which is both a proper noun denoting a certain language, and a common noun denoting a person from Germany), and most proper nouns can sometimes be used as common nouns – e.g. [_John_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/John#English) is a proper noun that is a first name, but can be used a common noun with plural [_Johns_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Johns#English) meaning "people named John".	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/proper_noun

Q184943		ML_POS_PTCL	particle	A word that does not fall into the usual [part of speech](#part_of_speech) categories, but which modifies another word or the sentence as a whole. The English term [_like_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/like#Particle) is used as a particle in many dialects. Particles are more common in other Indo-European languages (e.g. German [_doch_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doch#German), which marks a sentence as being surprising or rebutting a previous statement) and in East Asian languages (e.g. Japanese [_は_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%AF#Japanese), which marks the topic of a sentence). Many [clitics](#clitic) are particles.	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/particle
